"""Updates Subsonic library on Beets import
Your Beets configuration file should contain
a "subsonic" section like the following:
    subsonic:
        url: https://mydomain.com:443/subsonic
        user: username
        pass: password
        auth: token
For older Subsonic versions, token authentication
is not supported, use password instead:
    subsonic:
        url: https://mydomain.com:443/subsonic
        user: username
        pass: password
        auth: pass
